# Description
----
#### I have created an extension for the VS Code editor that incorporates trending Meme Cats to add some fun to your coding experience. The extension detects errors in your code and modifies itself based on the specific meme cat associated with the error. Additionally, it plays suitable background music to enhance the overall experience.
###
### To use the extension, simply install it in VS Code and add the small TV widget to your explorer panel as shown in screenshot 2. Then, sit back and enjoy coding with a touch of humor and entertainment.

# Warning
----
### WARNING: Please note that this extension has been set to play audio at its maximum volume level. We strongly advise you to adjust the volume of your Windows system to a lower level (between 10-20) before using this extension. Failure to do so may result in discomfort.

# About
----
* Brace yourself for the cuteness overload! Each time you open the application, you will be greeted with an absolutely adorable introduction that will make your heart flutter with joy.

* Congratulate yourself if your code has no errors because a celebration is in order! A happy-go-lucky cat will appear on your screen, and its upbeat music will fill your soul with happiness. But, be warned, after the celebration, a lazy, sleepy cat will appear, which will make you wish you could curl up and nap with it!

* Uh-oh! If there are 1 to 5 errors in your code, it's time to face the music - literally! A banana cat will appear, bawling its eyes out, and its heart-wrenching music will bring tears to your eyes. After the crying, a walking banana cat will appear, which will remind you that it's time to roll up your sleeves and get to work.

* Warning: emergency situation! If there are 6 to 10 errors in your code, an apple cat with ambulance music will race to your screen, warning you that you're in trouble. But don't worry, after the emergency, a walking apple cat will appear, which will give you a sense of calm and stability.

* Disaster alert! If there are more than 10 errors in your code, a dead cat with a mournful tune will appear, causing you to feel sadness and despair. And just when you thought things couldn't get worse, a spooky ghost cat named Maxwell will appear, haunting you for eternity. (Okay, that last part might be a bit too exaggerated!)

* Keep track of your progress with the LED screen that will display the number of errors in your code. It's like having a personal scoreboard!

* Finally, with the click of a button, you can either stop the session or play on. The power is in your hands!
###
# Suggestions
----
* The music button may only work if you hover your mouse over the upper side of the button. Please be mindful of this when using the extension.
* We recommend avoiding pressing the button repeatedly, as this may cause unintended behavior or errors. Instead, please allow the extension to fully load and respond before interacting with it again.
